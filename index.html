                <section id="section1">
                    <h3> Back story</h3>
                    <p>Contra is a term used for the game series meaning fighting spirit that spans over a number of years and is hard to keep track of the events but also because time travel 
                        is possible in the timeline. Basically though the story follows a team of special forces that serve to protect the galaxy from a variety of threats ranging from Aliens to terrorists.
                        The team is primarily made up of Men,women,robots and aliens. The events in the game take place approximately between the years of 1973 - 4444.
                        The Contra are sent in as the last line of defense to save the earth from alien invaders and the battles are usually against unbelievable odds. The Contra use a variety of special Weaponsand guerila tactics to defeat thier foes.
                        Some of the character are seen throughout many years and they do this by either being put in cryogenetic sleep or cloned.
                        Some of the battlefields are on earth environments, alien spaceships,bases or even inside or on top of the beast themselves.

                        The games were primarily made by Konami but a few games were made outside or alongside Konami. The trouble with keeping track of the games is the timelines
                        the games take place in and the platforms the games came out on, but also the naming of the games too. It can be very confusing but the games started out in the arcades in the 80's and moved to the home market in the 
                        on the ports made for games consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment system(NES) and many others.
                        The series of games has been a mixed bag an the series has tried to experiment with a variety of styles of game but the most popular style has always
                        been the side scrolling run and gun style game that has been the stereotype Contra style game ever since. The latest games have not been popular and fans want more Contra but 
                        Konami needs to stick to the side scrolling run and gun style game with fast paced gameplay. One game that was never really a Contra game but rather inspired by it is called
                        Contra Hard Corps Uprising. 
                        A fun fact about Contra is that Konami knew the game was hard so they included the infamous Konami code in it to give new players 30 lives since the game player has no hitpoints 
                        meaning that if you take one hit you die. Without the code you usually get 3 lives that will increment with your score but that takes time.
                        Most player will not use the code regardless as it is a badge of honour to complete a contra games with needing to cheat.

                    <h3> Weapons and Power-ups</h3>
                    <p>
                        Power ups are found when a floating pod with a bird icon flys past and the player has to shoot it to get the power up to drop.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Standard rifle</li>
                            <p>
                                The stock weapon you start with that fire one round at a time and can be fire faster with the rapid powerup.
                            </p>
                        <li>Machine gun</li>
                            <p>
                                Machine gun fire continuously by holding the fire button down and is identified by the M letter on the powerup.
                            </p>
                        <li>Spread gun/shot gun</li>
                            <p>
                                The spread gun fires five bullets at once at five angles. The gun can be fired as often as you hit the fre button and is identified by the S letter on the powerup.
                            </p>
                        <li>Lazer gun</li>
                            <p>
                                The lazer is the hardest but still powerful gun to use. It requires the user in some games to wait till the roung has hit the target otherwise the round will restart its journey from the gun which can make it tough to use under pressure. 
                                It is identified by the L letter on the powerup.
                            </p>
                        <li>Flame gun/flamethrower</li>
                            <p>
                                Depending on the game this weapon can either fire a stream of fire, a fireball that splashes into four directions or a spiralling pair of fire balls which can be useful for hitting a target while prone even if 
                                the target is offset from the normal path of the standard round from a machinegun,rifle or lazergun. It is represented by the letter F.
                            </p>
                        <li>Missile launcher/bazooka</li>
                            <p>
                                The missile launcher fires a powerful bomb that can cause alot of damage to a target but also splash damage to target behind cover. It is represented by the letter M. 
                            </p>
                        <li>Homing missiles</li>
                            <p>
                                The Homing missile launcher can fire between 1 and 3 missiles that seek out enemies but can sometimes do so at the wrong target because that target was closer.
                                None the less though it is very useful as you can let the weapon do the work and you don't even have to aim. The projectil is not that strong as the missile launcher.
                                It is represented by the letter H.
                            </p>
                        <li>Bomb</li>
                            <p>
                                Basically the bomb kills all enemies present on the screen at once if you use it. Very powerful but not too common to find.
                                It is represented by the a golden eagle icon in some games but can vary.
                            </p>
                        <li>Barrier/Shields</li>
                            <p>
                                The barrier powerup is represented by the letter B and makes the player invinsible for a period of time but eventually runs out.
                                It can kill units that you touch and absorb all damage to you.
                            </p>
                        <li>Rapid Fire</li>
                            <p>
                                The rapid fire powerup is represented by the letter R. It just speed up the rate at which you weapons projectiles travel for a period of time.
                                It allows you to upgrade existing weapon in use.
                            </p>
